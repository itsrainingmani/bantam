# Bantam

Rust implementation of the [Bantam programming language](https://github.com/munificent/bantam)

I wanted to understand how Pratt Parsers work so I read [Pratt Parsers: Expression Parsing made Easy](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/) by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent) and implemented the language. This repo contains a full implementation of Bantam and a test suite.

## What's next

I want to try making porting Bantam to wasm and provide a UI that shows how the parsing takes place
